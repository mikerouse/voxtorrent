## voxtorrent

a voxtorrent is a torrent of voices - people who want to reach decision makers on a given topic. these often land in the decision maker's inbox as a flood of emails. but what if we could control the flow and aim to resonate with the decision maker instead of irritating them with a flood of emails, which let's face it often just get ignored or fobbed off. voxtorrent changes the game by ensuring that what lands with the decision-maker is more likely to be listened to.

## controlling the flow

central to voxtorrent is how we control the flow of communication to decision makers, and the style of the communication.
